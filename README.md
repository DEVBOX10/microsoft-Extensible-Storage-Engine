# Extensible-Storage-Engine
ESE is an embedded / ISAM-based database engine, that provides rudimentary table and indexed access. However the library provides many other strongly layered and and thus reusable sub-facilities as well: A Synchronization / Locking library, a Data-structures / STL-like library, an OS-abstraction layer, and a Cache Manager, as well the full blown database engine itself
